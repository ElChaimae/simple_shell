Simple Shell
The main objective of this project is to build a functional shell in the C programming language that can read user commands, interpret them, and execute them. The shell should be able to handle common commands like "ls," "cd," "echo," and "pwd," as well as more advanced features such as input/output redirection, piping, and background processes.
This project equips students with experience in software development, teamwork, and collaborating on a sizeable project.
